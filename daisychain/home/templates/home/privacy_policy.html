<h1>{% blocktrans %}Privacy policy{% endblocktrans %}</h1>
{% blocktrans %}Privacy matters but it can be confusing. This page explains our approach to privacy on all our daisychain websites and how it affects you.{% endblocktrans %}
<h2>{% blocktrans %}Short version{% endblocktrans %}</h2>
<ul>
	<li>{% blocktrans %}We collect anonymous statistics about your visit, like which of our pages you viewed.{% endblocktrans %}</li>
	<li>{% blocktrans %}Some 3rd parties like Facebook and Twitter may know you visited this website, if you use their services. We can’t control them but we don’t believe this knowledge poses any threat to you.{% endblocktrans %}</li>
	<li>{% blocktrans %}If you sign up with us we take great care to keep your information safe and we’ll never share it with others without your express permission.{% endblocktrans %}</li>
	<li>{% blocktrans %}We never share your data with 3rd parties except to help us deliver our own services.{% endblocktrans %}</li>
</ul>
<p>{% blocktrans %}These are just the key points. If you need detail, keep reading.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

		<div class="panel-body">{% blocktrans %}We measure visitors to our website using Google Analytics. This records what pages you view within our site, how you arrived at our site and some basic information about your computer. All of that information is anonymous – so we don’t know who you are; just that&nbsp;<em>somebody&nbsp;</em>visited our site.{% endblocktrans %}<p>{% blocktrans %}The information we collect from analytics helps us understand what parts of our sites are doing well, how people arrive at our site and so on. Like most websites, we use this information to make our website better.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

			<p>{% blocktrans %}These services provide social buttons and similar features which we use on our website – such as the “Like” and “Tweet” buttons.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
			<p>{% blocktrans %}To do so we embed code that they provide and we do not control ourselves. To function their buttons generally know if you’re logged in; for example Facebook use this to say “x of your friends like this”. We do not have any access to that information, nor can we control how those networks use it.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
			<p>{% blocktrans %}Social networks therefore&nbsp;<em>could</em>&nbsp;know that you’re viewing this website, if you use their services (that isn’t to say they do, but their policies may change). As our website is remarkably inoffensive we imagine this is not a concern for most users.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
